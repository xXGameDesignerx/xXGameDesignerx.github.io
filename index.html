            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Xavier Martin, and I am a Game Designer that is looking to start a career in the Game
                Design industry.
                Graduating from Full Sail University in 2020 as my goals are to look for work in the industry of Game
                Design.
                For my years in high school and 3 months at Full Sail University. Working with Adobe products such as
                Photoshop,
                Illustrator, and Video editor has shown that my experience is geared towards game art aspects.
                I soon transferred to the Game Design program at Full Sail University. While I was going through the
                program, my mind was trying to test my limits as
                I did different courses each month throughout the entire program. After I graduated from Full Sail, my
                goals were to join a company that was a great
                fit for me or looks at other opportunities. I started to get think about ways to show my work through
                different platforms,
                while this was happening. My father and I started a two-man team that was started back in 2014. For
                about a year and a half,
                I worked on different sessions of unity. Map development, UI/UX, and small bits of coding to build
                interactions. After that time,
                we had two games developed, one was a single Player FPS zombie survival game. The second was Gunfight
                and this game was a multiplayer first/third shooter.
                I developed all the maps, and my father did the backend work. After we finished our first edition it was
                fun and engaging.
